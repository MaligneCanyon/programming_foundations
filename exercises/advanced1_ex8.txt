In the discussion for the Programming Fundamentals exercises, Advanced 1, Merge Sort, it's stated that
"After splitting the array into two sub-arrays, we call ourselves recursively, first on one of the sub-arrays, then on the other. Each of these two calls will sort the subarray by repeating this process until the trivial case of sorting a one-element array is encountered; at this point, we just return that array as-is (it is already sorted)."
But the subarrays are not sorted as described above, they are just split repeatedly until each contains only one element.  It is the merge method that does the sorting.  You can easily verify this by printing the subarray on the 1st line of the merge_sort method.  So, if I am correct, the above should read
"After splitting the array into two sub-arrays, we call ourselves recursively, first on one of the sub-arrays, then on the other. Each of these two calls will split the subarray by repeating this process until the trivial case of splitting a one-element array is encountered; at this point, we just return that array as-is."
