A), B)
# none of the vars outside the method are altered; vars in method are separate entities
# that are re-assigned, so the method is pass by value
"one is: one"
"two is: two"
"three is: three"

# gsub mutates its 1st arg (replaces it w/ the 2nd arg); therefore the method mutates its

"one is: two"
"two is: three"
"three is: one"
