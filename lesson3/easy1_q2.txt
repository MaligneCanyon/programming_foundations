  put ! before something, like !user_name
  put ! after something, like words.uniq!
  put ? before something

? (ternary operator) indicates a choice between two values for the var it is applied to
? as the terminating char in a method name, indicates that the method returns T or F

!= means not equal; use in a conditional statement
!something means not something, as in not the value of user_name
something! means a dangerous (usually mutating) operation
?something is meaningless ???
something? tests whether something has a true or false value
!!something returns whether something has a truthy or falsey value
