i/o
- target
- list of factors
reqs
- compute the sum of all numbers from 1 up to the target number that are also multiples of one of the factors
- if no factors are given, use 3 and 5 as the default factors
rules
- no dup multiples
- no neg factors nor neg target
- multiples in range 1 <= mult < target
model (summary)
- create a list of multiples of each factor from 1 up to but not including the target
- remove dups from the list and sum the remaining components
examples
- default factors
- single factor (1, mid-range, target-1)
- dual factors
- factors <0, 0, 1, 1<factor<target, target-1, target, >target
- target <0, 0, 1, >1
data structs
- int for target
- array for factors
- array for list of multiples
- int for sum
algo
- if target <= 0 exit
- if length factor_array == 0
	factor_array << default factors
- list_of_mults = []
- for each factor in factor_array
	if factor <= 0 or factor >= target exit
	current_mult = factor
	do while current_mult < target
		list_of_mults << current_mult
		current_mult += factor
- remove dups from list_of_mults
- sum component from list_of_mults
